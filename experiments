RNA 3D structure aligner usage: <method> <reference.pdb> <target.pdb> <aligning-mode> <rmsd-threshold> <output-directory> (optional)
Provided methods: geometric, genetic
Provided aligning modes: sequence-dependent (seq-dep), sequence-independent (seq-indep). By default sequence-dependent is used.
RMSD threshold: maximal RMSD score of resultant alignment. By default 3.5A is used.

Example input parameters:
genetic /home/maciek/zurek/rna_structure_aligner/example/6/3_solution_0_rpr.pdb /home/maciek/zurek/rna_structure_aligner/example/6/3_chen_1_rpr.pdb seq-indep 3.5 /home/maciek/zurek/rna_structure_aligner/example/6/output

Case studies:

1. The simplest example (our example used at web-page)

Reference structure is taken from 1st challenge published in RNA-Puzzles. Only chain 'A' is considered.
Model was predicted by RNAComposer based on the sequence published for this particular challenge. Again only chain 'A' is considered.

For all aforementioned examples global RMSD score computed between the reference structure and the model was under 3.5A (input RMSD threshold) so the resultant alignment should cover both whole structures.

In the below example the global RMSD score computed between the reference structure and the model exceeds 7.0A so the resultant alignment should be significantly shorter.
